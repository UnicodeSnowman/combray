Combray Gallery borrowed it's name from Marcel Proust's magnum opus "In Search of Lost Time" (A La Recherche du Temps Perdu).
</p>

<p>
Prior to launching Combray Gallery in 2013, Zoran Popovic was engaged in the Manhattan antiques market for over 15 years, most recently as a gallery manager of Ritter Antik. In 2011, he founded Popovic Appraisal & Consulting, full service antiques and art appraisal firm [see <a href="services.html">SERVICES</a> page].
</p>

<p>
We deal in European continental antique furniture and decorative arts and 20th Century design with concentration on Swedish Karl Johan, Jugendstil, Grace and Modernism; Austrian & German Biedermeier and French Art Deco/Moderne periods. We also offer other various period pieces selected on their merit, uniqueness and functionality. The fine art collection consists of hand selected contemporary works as well as traditional decorative landscapes and still lives.
